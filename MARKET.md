# Pixels Camp Market

The Pixels Camp open market is a way for participants to sell or buy services during the event using the `EXP` tokens in their balances.

Anyone can apply to sell a service, and anyone can buy services from others.

You can purchase a service to get help for your team, for example requesting time from a web designer, or get access to an exceptional mentor, or to advertise your project. Imagination is the limit.

The reasoning behind is, you spend and earn `EXP`s to increase your chances of winning the hackathon, either because you need the service because you'd get a better project, or because you need the money to invest in it.

## Using the market

To use the market, you need to be on [Slack][1] and join the channel #market.

Once there, our `@el_pixel` bot will listen to your requests:

**services**

Will list the available services you can buy. Each service has an ID, name, contact, and the cost in `EXP`s.

```
services
```

**buy**

Signal that you want to buy a service, and the address you will transfering your `EXP`s from:

```
buy 7 0x3D417b8305aA60688385a1Ca56530130C77F8739
```

This will trigger a private message with instructions on how to proceed for your payment.

**help**

Self explanatory.

You must send the commands in public in the #market channel. We think this will create awareness and dynamics for other users.

## Selling a service

You can apply to sell a service of your own in the market too.

Send an email to [market@pixels.camp](mailto:market@pixels.camp) with the following information:

 * Title of what you're selling.
 * A small description of what you're selling, with possible duration of service, if it applies (1 paragraph).
 * You e-mail and slack contacts.
 * Your wallet address.
 * The price of the service you're providing in EXP.

Our team will look into your application and decide if it's suitable to enter the market. If it is, the bot will list it, and anyone can buy it from then on.

## Questions?

Use [Slack][8], channel `#blockchain`. We'll be around.
